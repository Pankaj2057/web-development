      <b> Arrow function expressions</b><br />
      An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional
      function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate
      limitations in usage:
      <br />
      Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments, or
      super, and should not be used as methods. <br />
      Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with new
      throws a TypeError <br />
      They also don't have access to the new.target keyword.<br />
      Arrow functions cannot use yield within their body and cannot be created
      as generator functions.
