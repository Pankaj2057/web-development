      Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic
      messages, typically consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters,
      between two or more users of mobile devices, desktops/laptops, or another
      type of compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a cellular
      network or may also be sent via satellite or Internet connection. The term
      originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service
      (SMS). It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia
      messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), which can contain
      digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as
      emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and instant messenger
      applications (usually the term is used when on mobile devices).
