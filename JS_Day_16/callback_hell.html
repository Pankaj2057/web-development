      The callback hell in JavaScript is referred to as a situation where an
      excessive amount of nested callback functions are being executed. It
      reduces code readability and maintenance. The callback hell situation
      typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous request operations, such
      as making multiple API requests or handling events with complex
      dependencies.
