      is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent
      scope

      <b> closures</b> <br />
      (also lexical closures or function closures) are techniques for
      implementing lexically scoped name binding in languages with first-class
      functions. <br />
      A closure is created when an inner function has access to its outer
      function's variables and parameters, even after the outer function has
      finished executing. Closures capture the environment in which they are
      created, preserving the bindings of variables and parameters at the time
      of creation.
