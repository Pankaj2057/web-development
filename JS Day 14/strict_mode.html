      <b>Strict mode</b>
      <br />
      JavaScript's strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of
      JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode". Strict mode
      isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal
      code. Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with
      different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode
      without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict
      mode. Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist, so scripts
      can opt into strict mode incrementally.
